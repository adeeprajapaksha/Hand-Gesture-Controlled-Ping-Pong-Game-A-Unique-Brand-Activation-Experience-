Hand Gesture-Controlled Ping Pong Game: A Unique Brand Activation Experience!<br>

We’re excited to share one of our latest projects: a Hand Gesture-Controlled Ping Pong Game, created as part of a dynamic brand activation. This interactive game brought fun and innovation to life!<br>

* How it worked: Players used hand gestures to control the paddles, with the system built using OpenCV and Python.<br>
* The game allowed for single-player or two-player modes, making it perfect for everyone to join in.<br>
* Players competed to achieve the highest score, with the top scorer crowned as the ultimate winner!<br>

This project was a perfect blend of technology and engagement, offering participants an unforgettable experience while showcasing the brand’s innovative spirit.
